Require all types in given class or module-path entries to be fully defined at image build-time.

This option requires arguments that are of the same type as the
arguments passed via -p (--module-path) or -cp (--class-path):

  --link-at-build-time-paths <class search path of directories and zip/jar files>

The given entries are searched and all classes inside are registered as --link-at-build-time classes.

This option is only allowed to be used on command line. I.e. the option will be rejected if it is provided
by Args of a native-image.properties file embedded in a zip/jar file.
